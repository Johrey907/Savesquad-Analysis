Data analysis, financial dashboard, and profit distribution automation for the Savesquad lending group.
💰 Savesquad: Multi-Year Financial Analysis & Automation

📌 Project Overview
Savesquad is a community-driven saving and lending group. This repository serves as the central hub for our group's financial history, providing transparent data tracking and automated profit distribution logic across multiple operating years.

Objective: To maintain a longitudinal record of group growth and ensure error-free interest distribution.

Scope: Continuous tracking from Year 1 (Launch) through the current operating cycle.

## Reports and analysis 
Transactions are initially recorded in a MySQL server database. At the end of each month, the data is extracted from the database and exported to Excel for further analysis and visualization.

In Excel, the data is cleaned, organized, and used to create dashboards and summary reports. These reports provide insights into monthly performance and overall financial trends.

At the end of the year, the consolidated dataset is processed using Python to calculate profit distribution among members. Python is used to automate calculations, ensure accuracy, and generate final financial summaries for the group.

This workflow ensures that all transactions are securely stored, regularly reviewed, and accurately analyzed for reporting and profit-sharing purposes.
